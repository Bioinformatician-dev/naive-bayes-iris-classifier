# Naive Bayes Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of various Naive Bayes classifiers on the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers based on their petal and sepal characteristics. It uses Scikit-Learn's built-in dataset and models to evaluate performance across different Naive Bayes variants.

## Overview

The project covers:
- Loading and splitting the Iris dataset
- Training and evaluating different Naive Bayes models
  - **GaussianNB**
  - **MultinomialNB**
  - **BernoulliNB**
  - **ComplementNB**
- Comparing model performances using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
